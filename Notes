Using data basketball-reference.com, I will create a NBA team search app using react-redux.
The purpose of this app is to quickly look up current and historical data of NBA teams.

In addition, I will use RESTFUL routes to allow the creation of defunct NBA/ABA teams.

Stretch
- Search by team performance of a specific year
- Sift through team-player data
